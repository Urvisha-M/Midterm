# Midterm

### Improved Portfolio 
After reviewing the feedback, I tried to resolve the issues that I had in the previous assignment. I made sure that all of the required tests were passed, and that the media query becomes more responsive on various devices. I also included a footer on all of the pages. I gained a lot of knowledge from the final group project. I was able to understand how to convert an HTML file into NextJS format and how I needed to make separate components files for all parts of the design in order to create different pages that could be imported with the relevant components. I learned a lot about GitHub and how commits, issues, forks, and contributions work. I also learned about Vercel and how to deploy a site on Vercel so that it can provide users with a URL link. I was able to learn lots of new skills that I did not have previously.
